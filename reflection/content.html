            Reflection on FSW-105 at Bryan University.
        </h1>
        <h2>
            Challenges I had to overcome:
        </h2>
        <p>
            At the start of FSW-105 I was not familiar with JavaScript at all. It looked similar to GML, which I was familiar with, but I had never tried JavaScript. <br>
            I was able to overcome my lack of knowledge in JavaScript with the help of my instructor Mr. Rajani. It was also super helpful to have my awesome classmates, <br>
            Davey, Churchill, Petrina, Michael and Bobby to help me out. We supported each other and helped ensure each of us made it through this course with as much <br>
            understanding as possible. I hope we continue to do so throughout our college experience.
        </p>

        <h2>
            How I handled the workload!:
        </h2>
        <p>
            Prior to the start of college I was working a very demanding job. I decided to change jobs for the duration that I was in college. Unfortunately the job I <br>
            swapped to was just as demanding and college had already begun. I ended up joining a local delivery service where I could work on my own time in order to better <br>
            plan for my college assignments and manage my time. While it has been a struggle financially we have managed to keep our heads afloat and I have been able to <br>
            dedicate more than enough time to college to stay ahead in all of my coursework.

        <h2>
            My favorite things about the course:
        </h2>
        <p>
            Its hard to pick my single favorite thing about what I learned in FSW-105. My favorite methods were .slice(), .split() and .splice() because of how similar they <br>
            are but how differently they operate. My favorite topic was probably the constructor function / prototype paradigm because of how useful it seems to be in real <br>
            world application. Lastly my favorite assignment was the text-based RPG assignment in node because I'm a huge nerd for fantasy games.
